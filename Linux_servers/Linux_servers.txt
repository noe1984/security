chmod +x                this assigns execute permissions to all

octal mode 
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
- = 0

-rw-r--r-- 1 neomatrix neomatrix   0 Feb 17 01:02 file.txt
chmod 644 file.txt

change owner
    -rw-r--r-- 1 neomatrix neomatrix   0 Feb 17 01:02 file.txt
sudo chown  root:root file.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root      root        0 Feb 17 01:02 file.txt

ex for dierectories:
sudo chown whales:aquatic /TestUnix 


-----VIRTUAL TERMINALS 
-We can have up to 6 open terminals tty1 - tty6
ctrl + alt + fn     move between terminals. 
chvt + terminal number 

w                   it shows how many users are in my OS
tty                 this indicates the number of the terminal i am in.
ps -ft tty          list processes
kill + PID          this finish the process 

-----MANAGMENT AND MONITORING OF PROCESSES
ps aux                      it shows the processes running on the system 
ps aux | grep neomatrix     showing the processes of a specific user 
ctr z                       send a process to the background
jobs                        view background processes
fg                          bring in background processes

start a process but without losing the console
vi script.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "hi"
:wq
add execution permission

./script.sh &               creates a specific background process (this allows you to continue using the console)
nohup ./script.sh           this creates an output where i can see the actions the process is doing


-----MONITORING SYSTEM RESOURCES 
top             specific information about OS processes 
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i "Processor"     how many processors are in the system

free -h         it shows the memory information 

du  -hcs        hard drive state
example
du -hsc /home/neomatrix
du -hsc /

sudo ps auxf | sort -nr -k 3 | head -5      processes consuming more CPU 
sudo ps auxf | sort -nr -k 4 | head -5      processes consuming more RAM 

htop        package for a more organized managing of processes 


------NETWORK PARAMETERS 
ifconfig                its shows the network cards 
ip a                    this means ip address show 

ip -4 a 
ip -6 a                 specific type of addressing 

hostname                how i identify this host on the network 
route -n                default gateway

    sudo apt search "mysql-server"
    sudo snap search aws-cli

dpkg -l                     List all debs installed on the machine.
dpkg -i package.deb         Perform a package installation.
dpkg -r package.deb         Remove a package from the system.
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata     reconfigures this package

apt install package         apt repositories another way to install.


>>Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora
.rpm Red Hat Package Manager.
RPM database, located in var/lib/rpm
rpm -qa         List all rpms installed on the machine. (query all)
    rpm -qi bash
    rpm -qc bash
rpm -i package.rpm          Perform a package installation. (install)
rpm -e package.rpm          Remove a package from the system. (erase)

sudo yum update                 updating 
sudo yum install net-tools      installing a package 
rpm -e curl                     remove a package
