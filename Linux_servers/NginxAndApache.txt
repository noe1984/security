-----NGINX AND APACHE 
NGINX and Apache on Ubuntu server

Install Apache
    sudo apt install apache2

Install Nginx
    sudo apt install nginx nginx-extras

To verify if the services are running, the following commands must be executed:
    systemctl status apache2
    systemctl status nginx

Open the Apache configuration file, and change the port to 8080
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf

Open the following configuration file and change the port to 8080
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Restart Apache and Start Nginx. check later
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    sudo systemctl status apache2
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    sudo systemctl status nginx

Add the line proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the location of the following file
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

commands
    sudo netstat -tulpn         Validate ports that have an active process


If for some reason the Apache server is not on the same machine, we must change the respective IP address and port.
Apache has a command to activate sites that is a2ensite that receives as a parameter the configuration file defined in /etc/apache2/sites-available. 
NGINX does not have this command, which is why there is a soft link, that is, 
when we create a configuration file in /etc/nginx/sites-available we must execute sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ nginx_config /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

Apache also allows me to disable sites and add modules
sudo a2dissite 000-default
sudo a2enmod rewrite headers env dir mime

If we want to enable letsecrypt in NGINX, we need to add a line in the .htaccess to the path /var/www/html/host_name/.htaccess. The line is SetEnvIf X-Forwarded-Proto https
